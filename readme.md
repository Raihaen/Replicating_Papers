# Replicating Lit

This is a logbook for a small project where I try to replicate some methods mentionned in the literature.

Projects I plan to work on (in order of priority) :

- Optimal option market making and volatility arbitrage (Lucic and Tse 2024)
- Savine's differential ML
- Valuation & hedging of crypto inverse options (Lucic and Sepp 2024 - seemed fun).
